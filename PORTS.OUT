		XT, AT and PS/2	 I/O port addresses

Do NOT consider this information to be complete and accurate.  If you want
to do hardware programming ALWAYS check the appropriate data sheets (but
even they are sometimes in error!).  Be aware that erroneous port programming
can put your data or even your hardware at risk.

There are a number of memory-mapped addresses in use for I/O; see MEMORY.LST
for details on memory-mapped I/O.

--------!---Note-----------------------------
Note: the port description format is:

PPPPw RW  description

where:	PPPP	is the four-digit hex port number or a plus sign and three hex
		digits to indicate an offset from a base port address
	w	is blank for byte-size port, 'w' for word, and 'd' for dword
	R	is dash (or blank) if not readable, 'r' if sometimes readable,
		'R' if "always" readable, '?' if readability unknown
	W	is dash (or blank) if not writable, 'w' if sometimes writable,
		'W' if "always" writable, 'C' if write-clear, and
		'?' if writability unknown

	Note:	when SMRCe1, INTR can not be routed through the APIC, since it
		  is sharing the APIC interrupt input with SMI#.
  0	INTR Routing Control (INTRC): When APIC is enabled (in mixed or pure
	  APIC mode), this bit allows the ESC's external INTR signal to be
	  masked (forces INTR to the inactive state but does not tri-states
	  the signal). Thus, the CPU's INTR pin can be used (by providing a
	  simple -gate) for the APIC Local Interrupt (LINTRx). However, INTR
	  must not be masked via this bit when APIC is disabled and INTR is
	  the only mechanism to signal the 8259 recognized interrupts to the
	  CPU.
	=1 INTR is disabled (APIC must be enabled)
	=0 INTR is enabled

  3	Fast Off Timer Freeze (CTMRFRZ): disable the Fast Off Timer
	Disabling the timer prevents time-outs from occurring while executing
	  SMM code.
  2	STPCLK# Scaling Enable (CSTPCLKSC)
	=0 (default) scaling control of the STPCLK# signal is disabled.
	=1, the STPCLK# signal scaling control is enabled. When enabled (and
	  bit 1=1, enabling the STPCLK# signal), the high and low times for the
	  STPCLK# signal are controlled by the Clock Scaling STPCLK# High Timer
	  and Clock Scaling STPCLK# Low Timer Registers, respectively.
  1	STPCLK# Signal Enable (CSTPCLKE): permits software to place the CPU
	  into a low power state.
	=0 (default) STPCLK# signal is disabled and is negated (high)
	=1 the STPCLK# signal is enabled and a read from the APMC Register
	  causes STPCLK# to be asserted
	Software can set this bit to 0 by writing a 0 to it or by any write to
	  the APMC Register.
  0	SMI# Gate (CSMIGATE)
	=0 (default) the SMI# signal is masked and negated
	=1 SMI# signal is enabled and a system management interrupt condition
	  causes the SMI# signal to be asserted
Note:	bit 0 only affects the SMI# signal and does not affect the
	  detection/recording of SMI events (i.e., it does not affect the SMI
	  status bits in the SMIREQ Register). Thus, SMI conditions can be
	  pending when bit 0 is set to 1; if an SMI is already pending, the
	  SMI# signal is asserted.

PORT 0040-005F - PIT - PROGRAMMABLE INTERVAL TIMER (8253, 8254)
Notes:	XT & AT use ports 40h-43h; PS/2 uses ports 40h, 42h-44h, and 47h
	the counter chip is driven with a 1.193 MHz clock (1/4 of the
	original PC's 4.77 MHz CPU clock)
SeeAlso: PORT 0044h,PORT 0048h

0040  RW  PIT  counter 0, counter divisor	      (XT, AT, PS/2)
	Used to keep the system time; the default divisor of (1)0000h
	produces the 18.2Hz clock tick.
0041  RW  PIT  counter 1, RAM refresh counter	(XT, AT)
	don't set below 3 on PCs (default 12h), and don't mess with this
	counter at all unless you really know what you're doing....
0042  RW  PIT  counter 2, cassette & speaker	(XT, AT, PS/2)
	During normal operation mode (8253) 40h-42h set the counter values on
	write and get the current counter value on read. In 16bit modes two
	consequtive writes/reads must be issued, first with the low byte,
	followed by the high byte. In 8254 read back modes, all selected
	counters and status are latched and must be read out completely
	before normal operation is valid again.	 Each counter switches back
	to normal operation after read out.  In 'get status and counter'
	mode the first byte read is the status, followed by one or two
	counter values. (see #P0379)  Note that 16-bit reads performed
	without using the "latch" command will get the current high/low
	portion of the counter at the instant of the port read, so it is
	possible for the low part of the counter to wrap around before the
	high part gets read, resulting in a significant measurement error
0043  RW  PIT  mode port, control word register for counters 0-2 (see #P0380)
	Once a control word has been written (43h), it must be followed
	immediately by performing the corresponding action to the counter
	registers (40h-42h), else the system may hang!!

Notes:	XL-220/221 are based on LOGIC Devices L53C80JC4 SCSI controller which
	  is compatible with Symbios Logic (formaerly NCR) 53C80
	each SCSI data pin is inverted and compared with correcponding bit
	  in the ID select register; if any matches are found while a bus free
	  condition exists and SEL is active, SCSI controller will genarate an
	  interrupt to indicate a selection or reselection
	pseudo-DMA register is provided by some on-card PLM, and decodes any
	  address in the range 01x8-01xF; it should be accessed with 16-bit
	  I/O instructions only causing 2 SCSI REQ/ACK hanshakes (8-bit I/O
	  is treated as 16-bit, and second byte is lost); delayed assertion of
	  the REQ signal or bus free condition on the SCSI bus causes the
	  pseudo-DMA register to prolong ISA I/O cycle not asserting IOCHRDY

Range:	alternate address at 0150, 0160, 0170
Notes:	TMC-1650/1670 have a 25-pin external connector, whereas the 1660 and
	  1680 have a SCSI-2 50-pin high-density external connector
	TMC-1670/1680 have floppy disk controller built in
	BIOS versions prior to 3.2 assigned SCSI ID 6 to SCSI adapter,
	  versions 3.2 and greater use SCSI ID 7
	the drive ordering implemented in BIOS versions 3.4 and 3.5 is the
	  opposite of the order (currently) used by the rest of the SCSI
	  industry--for example, under DOS SCSI ID 0 will be D: and SCSI ID 1
	  will be C:
	Future Domain TMC-16x0 SCSI adapter series are based upon Future Domain
	  TMC-1800/18C50/18C30 SCSI controllers
	TMC-1800/18C50/18C30 are ISA SCSI controllers, TMC-36C70 is a PCI
	  version of TMC-18C30
	TMC-1800/18C50 have 8K FIFO, TMC-18C30/36C70 have 2K FIFO
	Future Domain TMC-1650/1660/1670/1680/1610M/1610MER/1610MEX SCSI

Notes:	any value written into the write loopback register can be read back
	  from the read loopback register unchanged (this is used by the BIOS
	  to test the controller)
	reading from read SCSI data register and writing to write SCSI data
	  register causes REQ/ACK handshake to occur automatically, reading
	  and writing the SCSI data no ACK register doesn't
	SCSI FIFO may be used only for DATA IN / DATA OUT phase transfers on
	  TMC-1800; on TMC-18C50/18C30 it may also be used for COMMAND phase
	  transfers

PORT 0330-0333 - Adaptec 154xB/154xC SCSI adapter (default address)
Range:	four ports at any of 0130, 0134, 0230, 0234, 0330 (default) or 0334
Notes:	Adaptec AHA-154x adapters use ISA bus-mastering mechanism, and so
	  require the DMA channel to be programmed to the cascaded mode
	the original AHA-1540 only supported asynchronous SCSI data transfers,
	  and did not support scatter/gather operation
	AHA-154xA+ supports the target mode implementing the SCSI-2 processor
	  device model; it executes INQUIRY, TEST UNIT READY, and REQUEST SENSE
	  commands received from the initiators without CPU intervention; the
	  CPU is required to provide information only for the SEND/RECEIVE
	  commands; other commands are treated by the host adapter as invalid
	AHA-154xCF supports Fast SCSI data transfer; AHA-154xCP additionally
	  supports SCSI Configured AutoMagically (SCAM) protocol
	AHA-174x EISA SCSI adapters in "standard" mode "look like" AHA-154x
	there was also an AHA-1640, an MCA version of the AHA-154x
	BusLogic BT-545S and DTC 3290 seem to be "almost" compatible with
	  the Adaptec AHA-154x

Bitfields for AHA-154x status register:

 5	mailbox initialization required (INIT)
 4	adapter idle (IDLE)
 3	command register full (CDF)
 2	data register full (DF)
 1	reserved
 0	invalid command (INVDCMD)
Notes:	bit 0 is only valid from the time the host adapter command complete
	  interrupt is set (bit 2 in the interrupt flag register) until it is
	  reset
	the data in register should only be read if bit 2 is set; reading the
	  data in register resets this bit
	command / data out register should only be written if bit 3 is zero;
	  the host adapter usually clears this bit within 100 mcs after CPU
	  writes to the command / data out register
	bit 4 indicates that the host adapter has no outstanding adapter or
	  SCSI commands
	bit 5 indicates that the mailbox initialization command (01h) required
	bit 7 is asserted after a power-on or hard reset (bit 7 in the control
	  register); when diagnostics is complete, this bit is reset and bit 5
	  or bit 6 is set to indicate seccessful or unsuccessful completion;
	  if the bit remain set, then initialization/diagnostic could not be
	  completed
	if bit 6 is set indication failed diagnostics, only the hard reset
	  (bit 7 in the control register) will clear it

Bitfields for AHA-154x control register:

 7	hardware reset (HRST)
 6	software reset (SRST)
 5	interrupt reset (IRST)
 4	SCSI bus reset (SCRST)
 0-3	reserved
Notes:	setting bit 4 causes the host adapter to assert the RST signal on the
	  SCSI bus for 25 microseconds (reset hold time); the reset is
	  managed as a SCSI soft reset, and will allow partially completed
	  operations to continue; use bit 7 to force a SCSI hard reset
	setting bit 5 clears all bits in the interrupt flag register and resets
	  the interrupt
	setting bit 6 clears all ongoing SCSI and host adapter commands
	setting bit 7 forces the host adapter into a state identical to a
	  normal power on state: diagnostic functions are executed and all
	  status for ongoing SCSI operations is lost, a reset condition is
	  generated on the SCSI bus; while the reset is being processed, bit 7
	  on the status register is set
	when soft/hard reset is complete, bits 4 and 5 of the status register
	  are set

Bitfields for AHA-154x interrupt status register:

 4-6	reserved
 3	SCSI reset detected (SCRD)
 2	host adapter command complete (HACC)
 1	mailbox out available (MBOA)
 0	mailbox in full (MBIF)
Notes:	bit 0 indicates that an entry has been placed by the host adapter in
	  the mailbox in; this interrupt should be reset as soon as possible
	bit 1 indicates that an outbound mailbox entry is now available for use
	bit 2 indicates that an adapter command has been completed; bit 0 of
	  the status register will indicate success or failure; during the
	  parameter transfers to/from the host adapter, this bit should be
	  examined to verify that the command has not been ended abnormally
	bit 3 indicates that a SCSI reset has been received on the SCSI bus;
	  CPU can convert the SCSI soft reset to the SCSI hard reset by setting
	  bit 6 of the control register upon the detection of the SCSI reset
	  interrupt; it is not set for the CPU-initiated SCSI reset (via bit
	  4 of the control register)
	if the host adapter command complete and SCSI reset detected interrupts
	  are present, the mailbox in full and mailbox out available interrupts
	  are not presented until the former are cleared
	if bit 7 of this register or bit 2 of the status register is set, host
	  adapter command complete and SCSI reset detected interrupts will not
	  be presented until the interrupts already present are cleared

Notes:	the MBO entries are scanned by the host adapter in a round-robin
	  fashion, i.e. the host adapter first looks into an MBO which follows
	  the one least recently used (and wraps around if it was the last one)
	the MBI entries are filled in a round-robin fashion, so the CPU should
	  check the next MBI entry after the last one that was found when a new
	  mailbox in full (bit 0 in the interrupt flag register) interrupt; CPU
	  should also check the next MBI entries to determine if more than one
	  MBI is ready
	MBI entries are absent in case of BIOS mailboxes; in this case MBI
	  status code is returned in the command linking ID field of the
	  command control block (CCB)
	target mode CCB may be posted to the host adapter in anticipation of
	  the SCSI command reception, with the direction bits indicating the
	  expected transfer directiin (i.e. SEND or RECEIVE command); if a SCSI
	  command is received by the host adapter before the CCB is prepared,
	  it requests a CCB from the host through the MBI

Note:	if a SCSI command completes with the BUSY status, the host adapter
	  periodically restarts it until it completes with other status
	if a SCSI command completes with the CHECK CONDITION status, the host
	  adapter automatically issues a REQUEST SENSE command with the data
	  length specified by request sense allocation length field; the actual
	  bytes returned are placed in the area allocated for sense data; but
	  if the request sense allocation length was 01h, no REQUEST SENSE
	  command is issued
	if the host adapter completes a SCSI command with the CHECK CONDITION
	  status while it is operating in the target mode, the same sense data
	  that will later be received by the initiator is also placed in the
	  area allocated for sense data
	command linking is not supported in target mode
	for a target mode CCB target device status field is used to indicate
	  to the host what status the host adapter returned to the initiator;
	  SCSI CDB field is used to return the CDB from the initiator

Notes:	in the initiator mode, if the target attempted to transfer more data
	  than was allocated by the data length field or the sum of the data
	  segment length fields, and the length checking was enabled via bits
	  4-3 of the address and control field, the CCB will be returned with a
	  host status of 12h; if the length checking was not enabled, command
	  will be completed without error
	in the target mode, if the transfer length specified by the SEND/
	  RECEIVE command is not equal to that specified in the target mode CCB
	  the host adapter will notify the CPU, setting the incorrect length
	  indication bit (ILI), bit 5 of byte 2 in the area allocated for sense
	  data; also, bytes 3..6 in this area will contain the residue of the
	  length requested in the SSCI command and the data length in the CCB
	  (MSB first); if it is negative the GOOD status will be returned to
	  the initiator, else the CHECK CONDITION status will be returned (with
	  subsequent REQUEST SENSE returning ILI in byte 2 and residue in bytes
	  3..6 of the sense data); the CCB will be returned with a host status
	  of 12h in both cases
	  will be completed without error
	in case of target bus sequence failure host adapter will generate a
	  SCSI reset condition setting bit 3 in the interrupt flag register and

----------P0380038C--------------------------
PORT 0380-038C - 2nd SDLC (Synchronous Data Link Control) adapter
Notes:	Initialization of the SDLC adapter is performed in a typical
	  sequence like this: Setup 8255 port A-C configuration by writing
	  98h to 383h, followed by initializing 8255 port C by writing 0Dh
	  to 382h. Reset 8273 internal registers by pulsing 8255 port B4.
	  After this the 8253 has to be programmed to the desired values
	  (counter 0 in mode 3). Now the 8273 is ready to be configured for
	  the operating mode that defines the communication environment in
	  which it will be used.
	Note on 8273: Each 8273 protocol controllers internal register is
	  programmed by individual set/reset commands (via 388h) in
	  conjunction with a parameter (via 389h) that give an OR/AND mask
	  to the internal register value.
	  Although the 8273 is a full duplex device, there is only one
	  command register. Thus, the command register must be used for
	  only one command sequence at a time and the transmitter and
	  receiver may never be simultaneously in a command phase.
	  The system software starts the command phase by writing a command
	  byte into the command register. If further information is required
	  by the 8273 prior to execution of the command, the system software
	  must write the list of parameters into the parameter register.

PORT 03A0-03AF - 1st BSC (Binary Synchronous Communication) adapter
Notes:	Initialization of the BSC adapter is performed in a typical
	  sequence like this: Setup 8255 port A-C configuration by writing
	  98h to 383h, followed by initializing 8255 port C by writing 0Dh
	  to 382h. Reset 8251A internal registers by pulsing 8255 port B4.
	  After this the 8253 has to be programmed to the desired values
	  (counter 0 not used, counters 1 and 2 to mode 0). Now, the 8251A
	  is ready to be loaded with a set of control words that define the
	  communication environment.
	8251A: The control words are split into two formats, mode
	  instruction and command instruction. The mode instruction must
	  be inserted immediately after a reset operation (via 8255 port B4
	  or setting command instruction bit6 to 'internal reset').
	  The required synchronization characters are next loaded into the
	  8251A (usually 32h for BSC). All control words written to the
	  8251A after this will load the command instruction.

Notes:	registers 10h and 11h have varying uses on VGA (see #P0708) and

	MDA, HGC, CGA: 6845 registers 00h-0Dh are write only, 0Eh, 0Fh
	       are r/w, and 10h-11h are read only.
	       The alternative initial defaults may be used
	       sometimes on modern adapters.
	HGC+(RamFont): as with HGC, but 3 additional registers for font control
	emulations   : more registers may be r/w, but most often it's the
	       same as with native 6845.
	MCGA (CGA+)  : Though this is a mixture of CGA and VGA, most
	       registers are same as with CGA, but with some
	       enhancements and incompatibilities to EGA, VGA.
	native EGA   : registers 00h-0Bh are write only, 0Ch-0Fh are
	       r/w, 10h-11h are read/write, 12h-18h are write
	       only. More regs may be r/w on enhanced clones.
	GenoaSuperEGA: adapter with chips SEQCRT GN006001 and GRAT
	       GN006002, e.g. c't Super-EGA adapter. Is EGA
	       clone with up to 800x600 and full 6845 emulation.
	native VGA   : all registers 00-18h are r/w, but 00h-07h are
	       write-locked if bit7 in 11h is set.
	ET4000	     : same as VGA, but with additional r/w registers
	       32h-37h, protected by 'key' except 33h, 35h
	       (see 3BFh for details). 35h is protected by
	       bit7 in 11h. The 'key' must be issued at least
	       after each power on or synchronous reset.

	an RLE count of 1 (two identical bytes) will cause unnecessary
	  expansions
	the peripheral device performs the interpretation of this byte as

 7-0	ECP-mode data
Notes:	data written or DMAed to this port are buffered in the FIFO and
	  transmitted to the peripheral using an ECP hardware handshake;
	  PORT 027Ah bit 5 must be clear to enable the forward transfer
	  direction
	when PORT 027Ah bit 5 is set (reverse transfer), data is read from the
	  peripheral and placed in the FIFO, from which it may be read by
	  reading this port
SeeAlso: #P0917,#P0923,#P0920

Bitfields for ECP test FIFO:
Bit(s)	Description	(Table P0920)
 7-0	test FIFO data
Notes:	writes to this port write to the FIFO, reads from this port read from
	  the FIFO, without actually transferring any data out the parallel
	  port; FIFO overruns and underruns are ignored, simply reading/writing
	  over the same slots again and again
	the ECR "full" and "empty" bits always keep track of the current state
	  of the FIFO; the write threshold can be determined by filling the
	  FIFO and then reading a byte at a time until a service interrupt is
	  set in the ECR.  Similarly, the read threshold can be determined by
	  emptying the FIFO, setting the direction bit in PORT 027Ah, and
	  writing a byte at a time until a service interrupt is set.

Notes:	if the port is currently in modes 000 or 001, it may be switched into

	  first be switched into either mode 000 or 001 before selecting a mode
	  other than one of those two
	if currently in an extended forward mode (010-111 and direction bit
	  clear), software should wait for the FIFO to clear before switching
	  back to modes 000 or 001
	if a FIFO overrun or underrun occurs, BOTH bits 1 and 0 are set; to
	  clear the FIFO error condition, switch the port to mode 000 or 001

Notes:	the SCSI latched data registers are used to transfer data on the SCSI
	  bus during automatic or manual PIO mode
	in a twin channel configuration the separate register set with the
	  addresses 00h-1Eh exists for each channel
	the SCSI/host address register (SHADDR) holds the host address for the
	  byte about to be transfered on the SCSI bus; it is counted up in the
	  same manner as SCSI transfer count register (STCNT) is counted down
	  and should always be used to determine the address of the last byte
	  transfered since the host address register (HADDR) can be skewed by
	  read ahead
	the source/destination index registers (SINDEX/DINDEX) are used by the
	  PhaseEngine processor to indirectly address the data memory (i.e. the
	  CPU-addressable registers); the data byte addressed can be accessed
	  through the source/destination indirect registers (SINDIR/DINDIR)
	  respectively; the source index register (SINDEX) is auto-incremented
	  on each read from the source indirect register (SINDIR), while the
	  destination index register (DINDEX) is auto-incremented on each write
	  to the destination indirect register (DINDIR)
	the function 1 register (FUNCTION1) is used to convert the SCSI target
	  number to the corresponding bit mask; first, bits 6-4 are written
	  with a number N (other bits seems to be "don't care"), then the
	  register is read back, giving the bit mask having bit N set and all
	  other bits cleared
	the host address register (HADDR) and the host counter register (HCNT)
	  are used for the DMA transfers from/to the host memory
	the SCB pointer register (SCBPTR) selects the 32-byte area of the SCB
	  RAM to be mapped at addresses A0h-BFh
	the queue in/out FIFO registers (QINFIO/QOUTFIFO) hold the queue of
	  the SCB pointer register's (SCBPTR) values for addressing the SCBs
	  sent by CPU to the PhaseEngine processor and returned to CPU (when
	  the associated SCSI command completes) respectively; CPU selects
	  the SCB RAM area via the SCB pointer register (SCBPTR), downloads
	  prepared SCB to addresses A0h-BFh (this requeires the PhaseEngine
	  processor to be paused), then places the SCB pointer value to the
	  queue in FIFO by writing it to the respective register, from which
	  the SCB pointers can be read (and removed) in the FIFO order; the
	  PhaseEngine processor places the SCB pointer of the completed CCB
	  to the queue out FIFO by writing the respective register, and CPU
	  can remove it from the FIFO by reading the register

Notes:	the scratch RAM is used for passing information between the driver and
	  BIOS and the code running on the PhaseEngine processor; it serves as
	  a working memory for the PhaseEngine processor as well
	location definitions overlap due to various sources giving different
	  scratch RAM layouts
	the PhaseEngine processor uses "ARG_1" and "ARG_2" to pass parameters
	  to the drivers and BIOS during sequencer interrupts; "RETURN_1" is used
	  to return results from the drivers and BIOS to the PhaseEngine code
	the PhaseEngine processor uses SCB pointer register's (SCBPTR) values
	  to link SCB in the lists, with value FFh indicating the end of list

 7-3	reserved
 2	chip select (CS)
 1	clock (CK)
 0	data out (DO)
Notes:	93C46 serial EEPROM chips have 1024 bits organized into 64 16-bit
	  words and use 6 bits to address each word
	only the first 32 words of serial EEPROM are used by the Adaptec BIOS
	bits 2-0 are connected to the chip select, clock, and data out pins of
	  the serial EEPROM respectively
	bit 1 must be pulled high and then low for a minimum of 750 and 250 ns
	  to provide clocking for the EEPROM chip
	bit 1 going from low to high causes the EEPROM chip to sample the data
	  out pin and initiates the next bit to be sent through the data in pin
	bit 2 must be set for a minimum of 1 mcs with the bit 1 goig high and
	  then low for the EEPROM chip to be selected; then the instruction can
	  be sent to the EEPROM chip
	instruction can be terminated by taking the EEPROM chip select pin low,
	  with the bit 1 going high and low

	bit 2 must be pulled high and then low for a minimum of 750 and 250 ns
	  to provide clocking for the EEPROM chip
	bit 2 going from low to high causes the EEPROM chip to sample the data
	  out pin and initiates the next bit to be sent through the data in pin
	bit 3 must be set for a minimum of 1 mcs with the bit 2 goig high and
	  then low for the EEPROM chip to be selected; then the instruction can
	  be sent to the EEPROM chip
	instruction can be terminated by taking the EEPROM chip select pin low,
	  with the bit 2 going high and low
	bit 5 requests access to the memory port; when access is granted, bit 4
